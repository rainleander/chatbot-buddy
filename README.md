# Chatbot Buddy
Chatbot Buddy is a GitHub repository created for the GitHub + DEV 2023 Hackathon, focused on the Maintainer Must-Haves category. 

Our project will use the Botpress chatbot framework to build a chatbot that can assist open source maintainers with their daily tasks. 

The chatbot will be equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities and customizable workflows that can be tailored to specific open source projects. 

The repository will include a pre-configured GitHub Codespace environment for developers to easily build and test their chatbots locally. 

With Chatbot Buddy, we aim to simplify the lives of open source maintainers while also providing a fun and engaging platform for chatbot development.
